# BlackJack
## Week 5 Homework for SkillDistillery
### Overview
This is a pretty simple game of black jack implemented in a very object oriented way. The program is set up as a casino application. You are a player in the casino. This casino only has the game black jack, however they could quite easily add more. 

As you sit down at the black jack table, you are asked for how many players will join you, friendly or otherwise. You then play a lovely hand of black jack with the rules implemented for you.

The goal of the game is to beat the dealer without going over 21.

I implemented many of the base features as well as a few extra game mechanics like tracking when people get black jack, soft and hard aces and extra players. 

I did not implement too many of the extra stretch goals such as splitting and insurance, however they are actually extremly easy to implement due to the nature of how I set up the game.

I also spent a decent amount of time mapping out how I thought the code should run and who should own what in hopes of not digging myself into a hole that I couldnt get out of. Take a look at my [UML](UML.pdf) for further understanding of how the program functions.

### Lessoned Learned
I think that my lessons learned are not quite lessons. This project has inspired me to ask certain questions that I hope to find the answer to. My biggest question is how to implement the Agile process. In this project I tried making a uml and then extending that into a program and it worked decently well, however, I had some concerns. It took me a while to simply get some output to the screen, I considered and tried Junit testing but at the begining I was only implementing getters and setters and things like that so Junit probably would not have told me to much. 

I am almost concerned that the aproach I took was more waterfall than sprint, however I have a reverse concern. If I did not make this Diagram and just started one user story at a time, I would have needed multiple large scale refactors to get my code to get to where it ended up. I am unsure which way I think is better or when to determine how big of a chunk to bite off at a time, especially considering that in comparison to industry, this is a rather small scale project. I hope to find out these answers in the time to come.
